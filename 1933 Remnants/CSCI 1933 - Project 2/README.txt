How to Run / How it works:

To compile program, run from the Game.java file in folder

The user is prompted whether to run in debug mode or not with "Y" or "N"
The user is then prompted what difficulty the game will be run in ("E","M", or "H")
From these inputs, a board is constructed which will continously ask the user to
input integer coordinates (format: "X Y") until all "boats" have been sunk

Common Bugs:

If the user inputs something that does not begin with "Y" or "N", the program will not run
If the user inputs something that does not begin with "E","M", or "H", the program will not run
If the user does not input the coordinates in the correct format ("X Y"), the program will not run
(also the scanner never closes, but not a big issue)

Ideas:

idea1 - ternary (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op2.html)
idea2 - loop label (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/branch.html)
