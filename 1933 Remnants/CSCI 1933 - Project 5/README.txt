Run the main method within BinaryTree.java when testing.

If you want to add more trees, you can create more within
the main method and change what you want to test.

Implemented helper functions (findNode, setKey, min, findLeaf)
to assist with applications of solutions. See comments in
Node file for more details on these functions.

If you attempt to uncomment BinaryTreeTest, the code will not
compile properly (from my experience). Use main method in the
BinaryTree file for testing.
